### ‚ú®&nbsp; About Me

Hello!

Starting with RF TEST Eng' and stepping into the semiconductor industry in 2020, I am currently a web developer and blockchain developer based on Solidity & Rust / ReactJS. I founded the Aslan Blockchain Academy, which has a cumulative membership of 154, including 41 developers. I am responsible for web development, infrastructure design, and operations.

Following the joy of immersion even before becoming a developer,

I am now deeply immersed in IT trends and development.

Above all, I value the true value of consistency, so I document what I learn on GitHub and operate a technical blog.

I internalize the principles of Clean Code and testing.

I strive for an approach that transcends abstraction and concreteness.

By planning and implementing the means of "environment" well, I continuously strive to grow together and take one step closer to the dream of "value".

With these tendencies, I am interested in finding a team and company where I can solve challenging problems and grow together, rather than simply repeating the same tasks and working on assigned roles. I focus on increasing productivity, code refactoring, and tackling new and challenging problems.

"If it's hard for the maker, it's easy for the user, and if it's easy for the maker, it's hard for the user."

As someone who will work hard in a job that requires lifelong effort, I believe that the process of obtaining that profession should be more challenging and difficult. That's how I can become a competitive developer with my own strengths.

I am a developer who is most satisfied when I can think about the essence of the problem and deliver value to the customers, forming a culture.

NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or anything like that. It is just a metric of which languages have been hosted by me on GitHub based on the usage across repositories. There are others which I haven't put up on GitHub.
